# Background

As an AI Development Intern at the CSF, you will be tasked with
developing pipelines.

# Assessment

Please answer the following questions in a jupyter notebook. You should
only spend about two hours on these questions. If you want to spend more
you can. If you\'ve run out of time, please describe thoroughly what
remains to be done and how you would accomplish it.

## Jupyter Notebook to Processing Pipeline

Given a jupyter notebook that has a functioning implementation of a
machine learning model that identifies unique individuals out of a crowd
through gait analysis, how would you translate that notebook to a piece
of software that can be used to apply the model to any arbitrary images
or videos provided.

## Demo

Write a toy implementation of whatever machine learning concept you
would like in order to demonstrate your skills. This doesn\'t need to be
in the notebook if you want to use something other than python.
